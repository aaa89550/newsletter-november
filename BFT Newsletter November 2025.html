                                    In 1818, Mary Shelley introduced the world to Frankenstein, the first science-fiction novel in literary history. Two centuries later, in 2018, Jeanette Winterson commemorated its legacy with Frankissstein. And this November, Netflix is releasing a brand-new Frankenstein adaptation. Together, these works remind us that science fiction is a genre in constant dialogue with itself—evolving across eras, revisiting questions of technology, humanity, and the unknown.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Comics have long been an important part of this conversation. Taiwan has produced a rich array of sci-fi titles that explore the boundaries of human identity, mechanical life, and the philosophical meaning of existence. For this November, we are excited to share a selection of four Taiwanese sci-fi comics, each one imaginative, probing, and original.
                                </p>

                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Op. 9 The Swan is set in a future where cloning technology has advanced to astonishing heights. Species of all kinds can be replicated to exhibit behavioral patterns similar to their genetic originals. The protagonist, cloned from a celebrated astronaut, appears ready to follow the footsteps of his genetic predecessor. But as he grows up, he begins to question everything: <em>Who am I? Am I simply what my genes are programmed to desire?</em>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    At its core, the story examines the tension between free will and biological determinism. As living organisms, how much of our paths are truly chosen? Are we merely expressions from our genetic code? The ending leaves readers with rich, lingering questions. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    <em>The Sun Rises in the Starlit Vale</em>, another story involving human clones, also describes the danger and mystery of extraterrestrial matter. The comic follows a girl born and raised in space, coexisting with an alien substance. The boy struggles to survive on an Earth gradually descending into ruin. Though they differ in origins, the two nevertheless share the same fate: navigating political power struggles, asserting their identities, and fighting to live on their own terms. This volume is the first of a two-part series.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Meanwhile, <em>The Invisibles</em> explores the social expectations imposed on women and their bodies. The heroine, born with large birthmarks across her body, endures an awful date. Soon after, a beauty clinic deceives her, subjecting her to a botched experiment. Now, whenever she feels intense shame, her body turns invisible.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Her condition mirrors the pressures women face daily: the demand to be beautiful, graceful, composed, and never “too much.” Invisibility becomes a metaphor for how women are pushed to erase themselves in order to be acceptable.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    The work contains many scenes illustrating the male gaze, yet they are woven lightly into the narrative. This is a rare and brilliant example of feminist storytelling in comics.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Finally, <em>The Projected Girl from the Underground Street</em> departs from the theme of physical form. Instead, it imagines a world where projection and AI technologies are highly advanced. Ironically, the more sophisticated the technology becomes, the more people yearn for the past. Artifacts surge in value, fiercely sought after in the marketplace.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    The protagonist and the female lead were once archaeology club classmates in college, until a plane accident took her life. Years later, the protagonist encounters her projection in a decaying underground shopping district. She possesses free will, yet has no memory of their shared past.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Their journey to recover her lost memories slowly uncovers the truth behind her mysterious “resurrection.” With its imaginative worldbuilding and distinctive art style, the story is both exhilarating and unsettling, full of twists that keep readers on edge.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    This book has now been translated into multiple languages. We hope even more international readers will discover Ding Pao Yen’s remarkable work.

                                    In <em>Op. 9 The Swan</em>, a baby named Chiyo is born on a winter night. Cloned from the DNA of a once-celebrated astronaut, he’s expected to inherit a dream not originally his own. At his side since infancy is Anders, a caretaker robot who watches over him devotedly. But as Chiyo grows, Anders begins to break down; his aging hardware means that an “upgrade” is imminent.

                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Chiyo knows his origins are artificial, engineered rather than destined. Even so, he lifts his gaze skyward—his favorite sight—wrestling with the truth that he may never be the heroic figure others imagined. Still, he clings firmly to his dreams. In a vast universe filled with planets, steel, and silence, he wonders: is there a place where both he and Anders can truly belong?
                                </p>

                                    Set in a richly imagined steampunk-inflected future, <em>Op. 9 The Swan</em> explores companionship between humans and machines, the search for self-worth, and the many forms love can take. Through the emotional dilemmas faced by Chiyo and Anders, the story reflects on identity, autonomy, and the longing for connection. Accessible yet deeply resonant, this tender sci-fi tale speaks to readers of all ages across the world.

                                    In <em>When Sun Rises in The Starlit Vale</em>, Earth stands on the brink of collapse. As humanity prepares for a mass exodus into space, a boy who remains on the dying planet crosses paths with a girl who was raised among the stars. Their meeting is no coincidence: it is deeply entwined with the fate of humankind.

                                    Shin Yan’s debut original comic interlaces the fragile sweetness of youth with the terror of an uncertain future. Through crisp pacing and striking visual design, she builds a kaleidoscopic sci-fi universe. Environmental collapse, technological upheaval, and intimate human emotions form a delicate and irresistible balance. Amid cosmic danger, the story captures the joys, griefs, and bewilderment of growing up.

                                    In <em>The Invisibles</em>, Shin Yan reframes the classic “invisible man” narrative from a female perspective. Instead of scientific triumph or voyeuristic power, invisibility here emerges from humiliation, shame, and the pressure placed on women’s bodies. After a failed cosmetic surgery, the protagonist begins to vanish whenever she experiences intense emotional pain. Her invisibility is not a superpower, but the physical echo of social violence.
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    As she struggles to control her disappearances, she confronts the reality that being invisible offers both freedom and danger. A police encounter reveals the paradox she cannot escape: whether unseen or fully present, her body remains a target of scrutiny. Invisibility becomes a fragile space between self-protection and exposure, forcing her to question who gets to decide how she is perceived.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Tender, unsettling, and incisive, <em>The Invisibles</em> transforms a long-standing trope into a contemporary fable about gender, shame, and autonomy. In a world obsessed with defining women by their appearance, the story suggests that true liberation lies not in disappearing, but in refusing to be confined by the gaze that tries to contain them.

                                    In <em>The Projected Girl from the Underground Street</em>, technology can project dazzling illusions of everything from street signs to people. Ming-Chi, once the president of his high school archaeology club, has spent years adrift after losing Li-Zhi, the girl he quietly loved. She was meant to leave Earth to start a new life, but her ship exploded during launch, turning a temporary farewell into a permanent loss.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Rumors of a “projected girl” appearing in an underground arcade reignite Ming-Chi’s hope. The apparition resembles Li-Zhi, and it carries her high school consciousness. Yet she’s unaware of their shared past. As the two reconnect, they are drawn into a mystery that blurs the line between memory and simulation. Why has she been revived in this form? Who controls her projection? And if she is made only of light and data, is she still the same Li-Zhi he loved?
                                </p>

                                    Blending soft melancholy with quiet suspense, the first volume of <em>The Projected Girl from the Underground Street</em> explores what it means to exist in a world where reality can be copied and emotions can be digitized. Ding Pao-Yen’s raw linework creates a striking contrast between nostalgia and futurism, giving the story a fragile, flickering texture. Unresolved yet deeply resonant, the tale lingers long after the final page, asking whether love can survive when only a projection remains.
